E-commerce Project Using Bootstrap
License: MIT

This project is an e-commerce website built using Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework that provides responsive and mobile-first design. The website aims to create a modern, user-friendly, and efficient online store that provides a seamless shopping experience to customers.

Features
The website features a clean and visually appealing layout that is optimized for all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The homepage includes a prominent search bar, a navigation menu, and a carousel that showcases the latest products, promotions, and deals. The product categories are organized into cards that display product images, names, and prices.

Each product has its own page that includes detailed information, reviews, and related products. The website also includes a shopping cart and checkout process that is easy to use and intuitive. Bootstrap's form controls and input groups are used to create a smooth and efficient checkout experience that minimizes user frustration.

Additionally, the website is optimized for search engines using Bootstrap's built-in SEO features, such as the ability to add meta tags and descriptions. This ensures that the products are visible and easily discoverable to potential customers.
